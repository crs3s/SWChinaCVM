This is a reference P- and S-wave velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle in the southwest China,
obtained by joint body and surface wave tomography.

* Model Data Format:
Lon Lat Dep(km) Vp(km/s) Vs(km/s)

* Method: Joint inversion of body wave (P and S-wave) travel time and Rayleigh wave dispersion data (Fang et al., (2016), JGR).
* Grid space: Horizontally 0.5 degree interval, vetically at depth 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70 km.
* Depth is relative to the surface (0 km).
